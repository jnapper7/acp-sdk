# Echo Agent

The echo agent simply repeats input to output adding a new
"assistant" message with a limited number of supported
transformations of the last "human" type message:

  * to-upper: convert text to upper case
  * to-lower: convert text to lower case

The agent is intended to be used for simple test cases where
access to an LLM is either unsupported or undesired. The agent
outputs a deterministic value based on the input to better
support testable outcomes.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.9 or higher**
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

##Â Running the Echo Agent directly

* Install dependencies
    ```
    poetry install
    ```

* Run the agent CLI using poetry
    ```
    export TO_LOWER=true ; poetry run echo_agent --human "What is actually up?"
    {
      "messages": [
        {
          "type": "human",
          "content": "What is actually up?"
        },
        {
          "type": "assistant",
          "content": "what is actually up?"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

## Running the Echo Agent using Agent Workflow Server

* Create an environment variable file if desired based on the example

* Make sure that the [workflow server manager](https://docs.agntcy.org/pages/agws/workflow_server_manager.html#getting-started) cli (wfsm) is added to your path

* Start the workflow server. Note the existing manifest 
assumes you are deploying from the directory with the `pyproject.toml` 
file for the echo agent. Adjust as needed.

  ```
  wfsm deploy --manifestPath deploy/echo-agent-manifest.json --envFilePath deploy/echo-agent-wfsm-config.yaml
  ```

  Using the output of the logs to get the values for the
  `API_KEY`, `AGENT_ID`, and `WORKFLOW_SERVER_PORT`, we can
  make a request to the agent using `curl`:

  ```
  curl -s -H 'content-type: application/json' -H "x-api-key: ${API_KEY}" -d '{"agent_id": "'${AGENT_ID}'", "input": { "messages": [ { "type": "human", "content": "What is up, Dude?" } ] }, "config": { "configurable": { "to_upper": true } } }' http://127.0.0.1:${WORKFLOW_SERVER_PORT}/runs/wait
  ```
